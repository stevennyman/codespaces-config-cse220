  // docker build . -t <insert Docker username>/<insert Docker repo name>:<insert tag name> (replace items in <>, tag name can be anything, a date such as 20230125 is common)

  // note: docker may require sudo
  "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" }, // remove this as well as the Dockerfile file if using a pre-made image (specify like above)
